# hanging_man_pygame
Using the pygame library I created a hanging man game. Check it out and some feedback would be great.

All the other files that I have used for this project is inside the hangman man folder along with the code for the man game.



Open the hangman folder.
open hang_man.py
The code hanging_man.py contains the drawing of the hanging man, the base, rope and the support.
Run the code on your IDE.

*Just for educational purpose*
Any feedback is appreciated.
